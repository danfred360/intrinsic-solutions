## Process For Collecting Content For The Instagram and Twitter Account.


	There isn’t any set way or standard way to collect content for posts. This can be accomplished in a few easy ways:

- Have Students in the major/department follow the main Instagram account and send the content they have to a private message of the main account.

- If a person doesn’t have an Instagram Account but has other social media accounts and wants to send content into the department for the Instagram account all the person would have to do is send the content in an email or text message to the point of contact for the Instagram account. (which could be posted on the website or on the Instagram profile, details.)

## Important Items To Consider.

	Make sure the person submitting the content is aware that the content they are submitting is going to be posted on an Instagram account or the website.
