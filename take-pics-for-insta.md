# How To Take Effective Pictures For Instagram



It’s not enough to post a few photos or videos, and wait for the audience to come rushing in. Instead, you have to build a content strategy just like you would for any other marketing campaign. The Instagram page should also look professional and well put together. To make an effective Instagram post there are a few things that should be done.

Why is taking good photos important for Instagram? Taking good, appealing photos using only your phone is the best way to stand out and build a strong presence on Instagram. 

1. Use natural light.
Avoid using the flash in favor of natural light, which creates photos that are richer and brighter. A flash can flatten out the photo and wash out the subject. If taking a picture outdoors is not an option,  take photos near windows or in well-lit rooms. Even at night, it’s preferable to find sources of ambient light, like street lamps and store windows.

2. Don’t overexpose your images.
A photo that’s too dark can be brightened with editing tools. Prevent overexposure by adjusting the lighting on the phone screen: tap and slide your finger up or down to adjust exposure. Another way to prevent overexposure is by tapping your finger on the brightest part of the frame to adjust the lighting before snapping your photo.

3. Take a picture at the right time.
Take pictures around sunset. If taking a picture during sunset isn’t an option try taking a picture when the sun is covered by clouds. Clouds diffuse the light from the sun and create a softer, more flattering effect.

4. Follow the rule of thirds.
Composition refers to the arrangement of a photo: the shapes, textures, colors and other elements that make up the images. The rule of thirds refers to a simple method of balancing the image. It divides an image into a 3×3 grid, and aligns the subjects or objects in a photo along the grid lines to create balance. Another pleasing effect is “balanced asymmetry”, where the subject is off-center but balanced out by another object on the opposite side of the picture. Turn on the gridlines for your phone camera in settings, and use them to help you with aligning the photo.

5. Consider the viewpoint.
Taking photos from a different vantage point will provide fresh perspectives, even when it comes to a familiar place or subject. Try taking the picture from above or below, crouching low to the ground or from a high viewpoint.

6. Frame the subject.
Leaving space around the focal point of the photo can add more visual interest than zooming in. Unlike a camera with an adjustable lens, a phone camera “zooms in” by shrinking the field of view. In effect, a phone is  just pre-cropping the image. This can limit the options for editing later, and interesting details can be missed. Instead, just tap the photo subject or focal point to focus the camera.

7. Draw the viewer’s eye.
In photography, “leading lines” are lines that run through your image that draw the eye and add depth. These might be roads, buildings, or natural elements like trees and waves. Keep an eye out for leading lines and use them to add motion or purpose to your photo.

8. Add depth.
It’s easy to focus solely on the subject of the photo, but photos that include layers, with patterns or objects in the background as well as the foreground, are naturally interesting because they offer more depth.

Be creative.
Some photos on Instagram are so popular that they become cliches, inspiring an entire Instagram account dedicated to repeat images. Don’t get caught up in Instagram photo trends and lose creativity. Stand out from other brands on Instagram. This will also help to establish a distinctive and memorable brand identity.
