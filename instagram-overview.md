# Instagram Overview


## How stories on Instagram work: 

Instagram stories can be a post you created, or simply any video or picture you have saved in your camera roll. In addition you can also add audio to the story that viewers can listen to. These stories will show up on the top of the instagram home page with a colored border around to show that the story has not been viewed. These stories will exist for 24 hours until they automatically disappear. Stories can be archived to be seen later by only the owner of the instagram. 

## How posts work: 

Posts are the same as stories that remain on your instagram page. You can delete these at any time or archive them. With posts you can write a caption and people who decide to comment on these posts will have their comments shown. In regards to comments, the owner of the page can decide to like the comments, reply, or delete any inappropriate comments. This will help greatly in user interactions and to help form a sense of connection between the viewers and the owner of the page. You can also link to other resources and pages through these posts. You will be able to see who has liked your post and who comments on them. 

## Direct Messages: 

Direct messages are private between the sender and the recipient. Instagram works the same as standard texting in terms of being able to see if the recipient has viewed the message. If you have a new message, a red icon will pop up in the top right corner of the home page. You can view your list of messages but cannot see what the person has said until you click on it. 

## How to edit your bio: 

You are able to edit your bio anytime you please. All you have to do is click on your profile and click “edit profile”. From there you can choose to update your bio and change profile pictures etc. Through this edit function, you are also able to choose a username that will represent your instagram, and add links to websites. You are also able to view your personal information related to the account such as email, phone number, gender, and birthday. 

## What is the discover page: 

Discover page is where you are able to search for any related accounts, topics, etc. The discover page includes pictures and videos of related content to what you have previously seen and a search bar on top. 

## Reels: 

Reels are somewhat similar to the discover page however, you are not able to search for anything and all the content will only be videos. You are only able to scroll up and down however you can like the videos, go to the comment section and direct message said post to anyone of your followers. You are also able to go to the profile page of whoever has posted the reel.
