# Breakdown Of The Instagram Algorithm


There are multiple algorithms at play across Instagram, with each one tailored to deliver content that it believes will be of high-interest to users in those categories. Keeping this in mind, once you understand how the algorithms actually work, you can tailor your content strategy to work alongside it.

There are four key factors that influence the Instagram algorithm for feed posts confirmed by Instagram themselves:

- Information about the post: Is it a photo or a video? When was it posted? How many likes does it have?

- Information about the poster: How interesting are they to you? Are they your friend? How often do people engage with their content?

- Activity: Do you tend to watch a lot of videos? What type of content do you typically engage with?

- Interaction history: Do you typically like or comment on the poster’s posts?

Based on this information, Instagram’s algorithm calculates how likely someone is to interact with a post, known as a “score of interest”, which ultimately determines the order in which posts are displayed in their feed. Instagram also takes into consideration the likelihood of five important interactions. These key interactions help the algorithm determine feed ranking:

- Time spent: Is someone going to spend time on the post?

- Likes: How likely is someone to like the post?

- Comments: How likely is someone to comment on the post?

- Saves: How likely is someone to save the post?

- Taps on Profile: How likely is someone to tap on the profile after seeing the post?



## What Engagements Are Most Important to the Instagram Algorithm?

Engagement is very important, especially when it comes to the Instagram algorithm.  Instagram considers how likely a person is to comment, like, save, spend time, or tap on a profile. Keeping this in mind, as content and captions are planned ask these questions:

Is this post likely to be liked or commented on?

Is this a post someone would save and come back to?

Does this post include a CTA (for example, “Click the link in my bio”) that will prompt someone to tap on your profile?

Creating content that will encourage this type of engagement can help you “hack” the Instagram algorithm for your benefit.

## How the Instagram Stories Algorithm Works.

The Instagram algorithm works fairly similarly for Instagram Stories as it does for the feed. Typically, Instagram Stories that appear at the start of a feed are from accounts that the user engages with the most. However, stories are designed to be “binge-watched”, so even if a user is not right at the beginning of someone’s stories feed, there’s still a chance they’ll swipe to your content. By posting to Instagram Stories more often, a user has a better chance of reaching viewers as they browse their daily stories and the more views gained, the better the ranking will be.

## How the Instagram Reels Algorithm Works.

According to Instagram, brands and creators should create Reels that are entertaining, inspiring, or experimental and use creative tools like text, camera effects, or filters. A user should also avoid posting Instagram Reels that are low-resolution, too blurry, or are visibly recycled from other apps. These types of Reels will be “deprioritized”, meaning they’ll be less likely to appear on the Explore Page and Instagram Reels tab.





## How the Instagram Explore Page Algorithm Works.

Overall, the Explore page and the feed algorithm are quite similar. They both deliver content Instagram thinks a user will be most interested in, based on the user’s prior interactions. However, while an Instagram feed is made up of content from accounts already followed, the Explore feed consists almost entirely of content from new accounts.

The most important signals for the Explore Page algorithm are:

​​- Information about the post. How popular is a post? How much engagement does it get and how quickly? If a lot of people are liking, commenting, sharing, and saving a post, it’s a huge indicator for the Explore Page’s algorithm.

- A user’s history of interacting with the person who posted. Has the user interacted with this person or their content in the past (even if not followed)?

- Activity. What type of content does the user usually like, save, or share? How does the user interact with posts in Explore?

- Information about the person who posted. How many people have interacted with this person in the past few weeks?

## How the Instagram Algorithm Works for Business, Creator, and Personal Accounts.

There have been rumors that the Instagram algorithm better serves certain accounts, with business accounts being favored. However, it can be officially put to rest as Instagram confirmed in a series of Stories on the @creators account, that all account types are treated equally when it comes to the algorithms.
