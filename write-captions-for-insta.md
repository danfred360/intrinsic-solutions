# How To Make Effective Captions On Instagram



	Instagram captions can be used to serve your brand more effectively to attract users to the brand. Effective captions can increase your website traffic, and help to get more Instagram followers. 

1. Write a good first sentence.
Approximately only the first sentence will be seen in a user’s feed, so make sure it’s compelling or asks a question and don’t put your call to action at the end.

2. Include a call to action or ask a question.
Each post should have a purpose and intention, so lead each one with its specific goal and let that goal dictate the call to action. What do you want followers to do? The key is to encourage engagement in order to create a sense of dialogue and conversation. This is also a way to work around Instagram’s algorithm, which looks at engagement as a metric to serve your posts to followers. Encouraging engagement also increases the likelihood your post will appear in other users’ feeds as a “recommended account” to follow.

3. Add information
In your first few lines write important tips or helpful information. Adding important information will make your post more likely to be shared.

4. Write as you speak.
Authenticity matters most. In content and captions, write as you speak. Write strategically and intentionally, but also come across naturally and like a friend to the user.

5. Draft Instagram captions on a separate platform.
Write captions on a separate platform in order to think strategically and distraction free. Remember, when drafting, keep the campaign and engagement goals at the focal point of the Instagram caption. Try coming up with a few alternative ideas for the captions, as the first one written won’t necessarily be the best.

6. Use storytelling.
Avoid being neutral, add personality and spice to the captions. 

7. Use emojis and have fun with them.
Sprinkle in emojis to add some extra flavor and animate the captions. Relevant emojis placed at the end of sentences or paragraphs can also serve as “bookends” and aesthetically break up long strings of copy. Emojis are also a great way to direct readers to take a certain action, such as clicking the link in the bio. But if emojis are used, make sure they fit with the tone of voice and branding.

8. Consider caption length.
Like most marketing strategies, the copy in the Instagram caption is about quality over quantity. It can be short and snappy or feature longer, more in-depth text.

9. Use hashtags.
Instagram hashtags are a key way to make posts searchable, so be sure to leverage them properly. They function like keywords, as they have tracking and searching capabilities. You may have noticed brands grouping hashtags at the end of a caption or below the “More” tag to keep things looking clean. Some even add several lines of space with periods to set apart the hashtags and really tuck them away from the description space. This is acceptable, but be open to sprinkling some hashtags within the caption to give it dimension.
